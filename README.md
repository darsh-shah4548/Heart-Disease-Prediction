# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A heart disease classification problem solved in Jupyter Notebook. The model uses Logistic regression to predict if a person will suffer from heart disease or not. Exploratory Data analysis was performed to understand which attributes of the dataset contribute the most to the target value and gain maximum information from the dataset. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to get the most accuracy from the Logistic Regression Model. Finally, a ROC curve, AUC curve, Classification Report have been shown.
